# IMDB WebApp For Data Analysis:
Built a webapp which analyses IMDB's large data according to the user's requirement. It uses OMDb API and official IMDB data set from (https://datasets.imdbws.com/), which comprises collection of movies, TV series, games, cast, crew and many more.

## Getting started:
- Data is gathered from IMDB's official website as well as from OMDb API using Node.js HTTP requests.
- Data is preprocessed to handle any missing or inconsistent value. Post-preprocessing, a thorough analysis of database is done using Pandason Jupyter Notebook.
- Generated ER diagrams, build schema in 3NF form and stored tables in MySQL database.
- The commands for all the above are mentioned in the QUERY document.
- For front-end, simple HTML/CSS and JavaScript is used. The backend is coded in Express.JS to parse through MySQL database for easy and efficient query retrieval.

## Installing:
Copy all files or Clone the repository locally.
Install all the requirements using following command on npm 
```bash
npm install
```
Start server.js
```node
node server.js
```
Go to the /public/html folder and run 'index.html' to run the webapp.
